# Java - Random Numbers

A simple Java mini-program created to practice arrays, loops, the `Random` class and basic calculations.  
This exercise generates a list of random integers, prints them to the console and calculates the total sum and average.

## Academic Context
This mini-project was developed as part of my Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Software Development) @ the National College of Ireland.  
It is one of the hands-on Java exercises used to strengthen fundamentals such as arrays, loops and arithmetic operations.

## Features
- Generates random integers using `java.util.Random`
- Stores values in an integer array
- Iterates through the array using a loop
- Calculates the sum of all elements
- Calculates the average (mean) value
- Prints the array, sum and average to the console

## Purpose
This project is part of my Java learning journey and focuses on:
- Practising array manipulation
- Using loops to process data
- Applying basic maths operations in code
